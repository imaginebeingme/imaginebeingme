Hi, I'm Jahdai! ðŸ˜Ž I'm a graphic designer who blends art and strategy, excelling in visuals, print, and digital design. I enjoy brainstorming, leading projects, and collaborating with others. My passion lies in creating visually captivating work that leaves a lasting impact.

One of my goals is to become a front-end developer so that I can take my web designs from initial concept to something interactive. I only use html + CSS. recently began learing [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).
